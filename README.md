# PneumoniaDetector
Predictive Model for Pneumonia
This program utiizes a neural network to train a model to detect pneumonia in images of chest x-rays. The model can read new images and predict them as "normal" or "pneumonia." At time of this entry, the model shows an accuracy of > 98%. Dataset collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
